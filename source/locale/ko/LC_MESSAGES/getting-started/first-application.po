"The secondary ticket market, also known as the resale market, is the "
"exchange of tickets that happens between individuals after they have "
"purchased a ticket from an initial vendor. The initial vendor could be "
"the event website, an online ticket vending platform, a shop, or a stall "
"at the entrance of the event."

"Buying a ticket from someone that is not the initial vendor does not "
