"The **Symbol SDK** is the primary software development tool to create "
"|codename| components, such as additional tools, libraries, or "
"applications. It enables developers to focus on their product rather than"
" on the specific API details due to its higher abstraction."

"**Fast language adaptation**: For example, there is a |sdk| for Java, but"
" you need to work on C++. As both SDKs share the same design, you could "
