"|codename| follows the **Hashed TimeLock Contract** (HTLC) protocol to "
"create a trustless environment for the decentralized exchange of assets. "
"The protocol guarantees that if all participants agree, the swap will "

" funds back if some of them decide not to conclude the process."

"HTLC uses *hashlocks* and *timelocks* to reduce the counterparty risk. "
