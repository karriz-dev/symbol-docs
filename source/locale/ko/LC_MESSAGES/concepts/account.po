"An account is a :ref:`key pair <keypair>` (private and public key) "
"associated with a mutable state stored on the blockchain."

#: ../../source/concepts/account.rst:7
msgid ""
"In other words, an account is a **deposit box**, which can be used to "
"hold XYM, other mosaics, and specialized assets. However, the assets held"
" in the box can only be moved with the associated private key."

"Moreover, |codename| accounts can also represent **non-fungible assets** "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/account.rst:28
msgid ""
"The public key is used to verify the account's signatures. It is stored "

msgid ""
"Each account has a unique :ref:`address <address>` derived from the "
