"It should come as no surprise that cryptocurrency users are targeted by a"
" wide variety of scammers, hackers, and thieves. While some attempts may "
"come in familiar forms such as impersonation or misinformation, the "
"digital nature of cryptocurrencies opens the door to a number of novel "
"approaches. This page is intended to help you ensure the security of your"
" assets by explaining a number of common scams and security "
"considerations. This list is by no means comprehensive, and you are "
"strongly encouraged to research the topic further for the sake of your "

"It may not be immediately apparent that you've been hacked. The sweeper's"

"harvesting, or that your balance was transferred to a delegated "
"harvesting address linked to your account."
