"The :doc:`running-a-symbol-node` guide explains how to easily **create a "
"node using Symbol Bootstrap**. In that guide, the setup process is "
"conducted on the same machine that will host the node, meaning that "
"private keys are generated on a machine connected to the Internet. If you"

"The **summary** of it is that the ``symbol-bootstrap start`` command is "
