"Fundamentally, we believe that coding is as much art as science and a "
"good code review will have some bit of back and forth between reviewers "
"and author. Consequently, during the course of a review, there might be "
"multiple commits incorporating feedback. While keeping these separate "
"during the review helps the reviewers, the usefulness of memorializing "
"these changes is minimal. As a result, we generally squash all commits "
"composing a Pull Request into a single commit. This helps to keep our git"
" log tidy as well as strongly encourage relatively small, single purpose "
"Pull Requests."

"Do not combine multiple changes in a single review. For example, if you "
"want to rename a commonly used function and change its functionality, "
"we'd much prefer two PRs - one for the rename and one for the "
"functionality change - rather than one. **NEVER** combine reformatting "
"changes with functionality changes."
